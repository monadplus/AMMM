a) Explain the model
b) Why z is guaranteed to be equal to the load of the highest loaded computer?

The model is very simple except for z which is explained below.

It is guaranteed because z must be at least the maximum of x_tc and because it is a minimization problem, so z is at most the maximum of x_tc. Hence, z = maximum of x_tc.

c) Implement the model in OPL and solve it using CPLEX
d) Write a processing block to check whether the load requested by all the tasks can be served by the computers
e) Implement the model (second implementation) in OPL and solve it using CPLEX

See `monitor` directory.

f) Analyze the computer's processing capacity and indicate whether is possible to reduce it.

The capicity of all processors is at 0.723773179127243.
Hence, we could reduce the processors capacity by (1-0.723773179127243).
